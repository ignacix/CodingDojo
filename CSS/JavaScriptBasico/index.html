            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language
                . JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is
                a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for 
                developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside
                a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to
                the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values
                        - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
                        a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
                        These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x</span>; 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our 
                        cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. 
                        The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x = 10</span>;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to 
                        know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - 
                        <span>true</span> or <span>false</span>; null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159</span>; String - <span>"Coding 
                            Dojo Rocks!"</span>; Array - <span>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions 
                        - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You 
                        can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following 
                        conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; 
                        <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute 
                        this block of code;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all 
                        essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine 
                        you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop! 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will
                        run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are 
                        putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we 
                        screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our 
                        instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
                    </p>
